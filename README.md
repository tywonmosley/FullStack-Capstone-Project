# FullStack-Capstone-Project

## Milestone 1 - Wireframe and Schema
Now that you have determined you project and planned for completion using GitHub, it is time to develop a high-level plan by creating a wireframe and/or schematic.

### Procedure
- Complete a wireframe and/or schema for for your selected project. 
  - Note: A wireframe or schema can be a hand-drawn sketch, a sharable link to a resource used to create the wireframe and/or schema, or a simple white boarding screenshot. Any artifact that demonstrates planning of the application and its functionality will work for this milestone. 
- Open and copy this milestone one resourceLinks to an external site.. Complete the prompts and submit it below as a sharable link that your instructional team can view. 

## Milestone 2 Deliverables
If you are working individually, submit proof of the following deliverables:

- Unit tests for critical React components
- Tests for different scenarios, such as edge cases and error conditions
- Login/Logout functionality finished
- Fetch functions used for all products, login, signup, and logout
- Single Product and Cart Components rendering using dummy data
- 50% MVP Completion
- Test written 

## Milestone 3 Deliverables
If you are working individually, submit proof of the following deliverables:

- Basic styles implemented
- Logged-out User functionality finished
- Single Product Component renders using fetch
- “Add item to cart” functionality working
- Checkout page has a form to take customer billing information (dummy info)

## Milestone 4 Deliverables
If you are working individually, submit proof of the following deliverables:

- CSS animations on pseudo-class selector rulesets
- Logged in User can view and edit their cart
- Checkout Page takes form information for a successful checkout
- Cohesive styling is implemented

## Capstone Project Grading
Your instructional team members will review your capstone project in its completed state and score it based on the rubric, so review the requirements thoroughly. Please submit a link to your GitHub repository.

 

### Reflect on the process in your Professional Tech Journal.

- Did your project plan run seamlessly? Or did you have to revise throughout? 
- How did your team communicate? What could you have improved on? What went well? 
- What were your major lessons learned? 
- Which part of full-stack development did you enjoy the most? The least? 
- Record anything else you think might be of value to remember!

### Capstone Rubric - Individual (Core)

#### This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome

- Deployment
  - The project is properly deployed and accessible to the internet.

  - The website loads and can be interacted with.

- Project Management 
  - The status of tickets and issues accurately reflects the state of the website. i.e. Features described as "done" are actually working.

  -  The Github repository shows an active history with consistent and meaningful commit messages and pull requests.

- Frontend
  - The website is styled with CSS and effort has been made towards usable and elegant UX.

  - There is effective use of React components, hooks, and state management.

  - React Router is used appropriately to handle separate pages in the application.

  - Redux Toolkit and RTK Query are effectively used to handle global state and communication with the API.


- Backend
  - The Prisma schema defines appropriate models for the database.

  - The database is seeded with appropriate data.

  - API endpoints are implemented and send responses with the correct data and status codes.

  - API endpoints use Prisma Client to perform the proper CRUD operations.

  - bcrypt and JWT are used to implement authentication.


- Testing
  - There are unit tests for each API endpoint.

  - There are unit tests for critical React components.

  - There is evidence of testing for different scenarios, such as edge cases and error conditions.


- Documentation
  - The README contains clear instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

  - The README contains a clear and concise overview of the project's purpose and functionality.


  - Complex or non-obvious sections of code are explained in comments.


- Code Quality
  - Code is consistently styled and formatted.

  - Variables and functions have meaningful names and follow consistent naming conventions.

  - There is evidence of effort towards keeping the code well-organized and modular.
